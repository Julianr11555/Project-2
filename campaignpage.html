Help give proboscis monkeys in Sumatra and Borneo the best chance of survival against the threat of extinction. 
Support our work including critical habitat protection, proboscis monkey care centres and rehabilitation and release programs.

The projects funded by The Proboscis Monkey Project not only include direct proboscis monkey conservation, such as proboscis rescue, rehabilitation and 
release programs, but also forest habitat protection and regeneration, education, research and local community partnerships.
